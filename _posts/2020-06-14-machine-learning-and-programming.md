## Motivation and Backgroud 

The media has recently been pushing a lot of machine learning and deep learning in the recent years. From AlphaGo in 2016 mastering the game of Go to Tesla Autopiolot we are all aware of the promise of machine learning. 

What are the limits of the machine learning though? Is it coming for our jobs as software developers? For these reasons and more, I spent quite a few months learning how deep neruarl networks work. I feel that I have a good knowledge to answer the questions above. 

The rest of this post will talk through what I learned, and then based on that the outcome I arrived to. If just want the answer skip to the bottom. 


## The basics of machine learning

Let's really breifly cover off the basics of machine learning. Machine larning is not new, and is actually been around decades. I took a couple of papers on it at unvieristy. The feild goes back before me though, through to the 1980s and earlier. 

Simple put, machine learning is the task of a computer, iterativly tyring to find a mathmatical function that most actaully descibes the data it is presented with.  
This could be a simple linear function for house prices and bedreooms. Or it could be much more complicted as with the case of AlphaGo. 

The key parts to machine learning are: 
- data to trained on
- a function to be learning
- a lot of simulations 


## What has changed with deep learning?

Deep learning is really the natural progression of machine learning. All of the three items mentioned above have improved over the last decade to bring about new possiblites. 

Deep learning is the reuslt of:
- Web 2.0 where are we have massive datasets created by human activity
- Improved algorithms that learn much faster (VGG16, RestNet50, LTSM, etc)
- Improved GPU hardware

When these items are all combined, amazing things happen and that is what the industy has called deep learning. Instagram with hsatgs, is a dataset created perfectly for machine learning. Facebook is now benefitting from that. 

We can be a bit more precise about deep learning though. 



## How machine learning really learns
- unsupervised
- supervised
    - reinforcement

## What machine learning can't do!

- no data (or simulator), then it cna't learn 
- no measure of improvement then it can't learn
- no way to run repeatedly 


## How would we define our jobs as developers?

- there needs to be a spec~
- There must be a form of observation   
    - machine learning is simply a copy
- Small parts will be automed
- Humans are reealy really smart
    - self driving cars are coming
    - humans will always be better (we have better 'hardware')
    - side note: humans' attention span is bad making us bad drivers. 


## Are our jobs safe then?

Yes, for as long as long we don't have self-driving cars, I think our jobs are fine. 
Most of the work of a software developer is an interaction with both a human and a computer. THe human part can not be machine-learned yet. That human might be a BA, a product manager or an end-user. In any case, those requirements are stil going to be way to vague for a computer to program. Mostly likely those requirements are incomplete, and it's our jobs to communicate what the computer can do. 

The only exception to this, would be if the domain could be mapped to that of computer vision or langauge (audio or written). In those cases, it's very likely that the developers job will change. Instead of harding coding software, the job will change to a data-science one.
